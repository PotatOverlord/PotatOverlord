I made this account to add more recipes to ss14.  
  
So far I plan to add:  
Tzirian foods (https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/59412)  
Moffic foods (https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/63174)  
Every meat burrito from regular show  
Allow positronic brains to be picked up by latejoin  
Give borgs a door remote w/ shock for malfs  
Add borgs to species guidebook  
  
I want to add, but probably will never figure out how to:  
Borg loadouts (custom name, starter chassis other than default w/ basic modules)  
Give construction module a whitelisted inventory + hand  
Give pAI's a posi brain adaptor  
Fuck secborgs I will fight tooth and nail against secborgs, but if somebody manages to make a good implementation of them I'll like it
